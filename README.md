##  RS-CFSFX-N01-2

The RS-485 standard allows for two different data line configurations:

### RS-485-A:
In the RS-485-A configuration, the A (positive) and B (negative) data lines are connected as follows:
A to A
B to B

### RS-485-B:

In the RS-485-B configuration, the A and B lines are swapped:
A to B
B to A

** The RS-CFSFX-N01-2 follows the RS-485-B convention **
